				<h2>Development</h2>
					<p>As with its predecessors, Sonic 3 was developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. Yuji Naka and Hirokazu Yasuhara were the primary creators of the Sonic 3 design document and project schedule. Sonic 3 began as a top-down, isometric game, similar to what would become Sonic 3D Blast (1996), but the concept was abandoned early as the team did not want to change the Sonic formula too radically for a sequel. According to Sonic producer and programmer Yuji Naka, the team felt that they needed a deeper story to expand the world of Sonic, which "made the project huge." Thus, they introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles the Echidna and made the levels triple the size of those found in Sonic 2.</p>

					<p>Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were originally planned as a single game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The cartridge has a small amount of non-volatile RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the game cartridge. Sega planned to release a single cartridge version of both games, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.</p>

					<p>Sonic 3 was released on February 2, 1994 in North America and February 24 in Europe. To help promote the game's European release, the British band Right Said Fred adapted the song "Wonderman" to include references to Sonic. The song was used in the game's advertisements and was also released as a single, which charted in the UK at number 55.</p>

				<h2>Michael Jackson?</h2>

					<p>In 2005, former Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector stated that Sega brought in American pop musician Michael Jackson to compose music for Sonic 3, but following the allegations of sexual abuse against Jackson, his involvement was terminated and the music reworked. The website of musician Cirocco Jones, who contributed music to Sonic 3 and is credited in-game as "Scirocco", credits himself along with Jackson and Jackson's tour keyboardist and songwriting collaborator Brad Buxer for musical cues for "levels 2 & 3" of "Sonic the Hedgehog". However, senior Sega staff later stated that any involvement of Jackson was arranged without their knowledge, and no contracts nor formal agreements were ever made.</p>

					<p>In a 2009 interview with French magazine Black & White, Buxer stated that Jackson was involved with some Sonic 3 compositions, but chose to remain uncredited because he was unhappy with the sound capabilities of the Genesis. He also said that the Sonic 3 credits music later became the basis for Jackson's 1996 single, "Stranger in Moscow". In 2013, it was discovered that the musical theme for IceCap Zone closely resembles a previously unreleased 1982 track, "Hard Times", by The Jetzons, for which Buxer was the keyboardist and co-songwriter.</p>

					<p>In October 2013, GameTrailers dedicated an episode of its Pop Fiction series to examining Jackson's involvement with the game. Roger Hector, who previously stated that Jackson's involvement in the game was dropped due to the sexual abuse allegations, stated that any similarities to Jackson's music in Sonic 3 was not intentional on Sega's part. However, an anonymous source involved in the game's development reaffirmed Buxer's statements and said Jackson was involved before the scandals came to light in August 1993, and that his contributions remained in the game with Jackson choosing to remain uncredited. The source specified that the musical theme for Carnival Night Zone was one of the pieces to which Jackson contributed.</p>

					<h3>Video Mashups</h3>

						<p>Due to the buzz created around the Michael Jackson composition debate, some fans have taken it upon themselves to mix together some of Jackson's hits with tracks from the Sonic 3 soundtrack. Compare for yourself to see if the King of Pop wrote the charts.</p>
