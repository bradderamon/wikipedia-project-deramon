				<h2>Sonic 3</h2>

					<p>Dr. Robotnik's space station, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mystical floating landmass called Angel Island after Sonic and Tails defeat him at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. As Robotnik begins to repair the damaged station, he meets Knuckles the Echidna, the last surviving member of an ancient echidna civilization that once inhabited the island, as well as the guardian of the Master Emerald, which grants the island its levitation powers. Realizing Sonic and Tails will try to track him down, Robotnik dupes Knuckles into believing Sonic is trying to steal the Master Emerald, turning the two against each other while Robotnik tries to repair his space station.</p>

					<p>Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails approach Angel Island in their biplane, the "Tornado". Sonic jumps off the plane and, using the Chaos Emeralds, turns into Super Sonic, and zooms towards the island. When they arrive, Knuckles ambushes Sonic from underground, steals the emeralds, and disappears inland. As Sonic and Tails travel through the island, they frequently encounter Knuckles and Robotnik, who hinder their progress with various traps. Sonic and Tails eventually arrive at the Launch Base, where the destroyed Death Egg is being repaired. They fight with Knuckles, but the Death Egg launches back into the sky, leaving him behind. They fight Robotnik one last time on a platform attached to the underside of the Death Egg. They defeat him, and the resulting explosion drops Sonic and Tails away from the Death Egg, which crash-lands farther off on Angel Island again. The story continues in Sonic & Knuckles.</p>

				<h2>Sonic & Knuckles</h2>

					<p>The story begins immediately after the events of Sonic 3, where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.</p>

					<p class="sn-last-para">Knuckles' story begins in Mushroom Hill,[b] where he is relaxing with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him through most of the same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.</p>

					<h3>Sonic</h3>

						<p>Sonic the Hedgehog is the title character and protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series released by Sega, as well as numerous spin-off comics, animations, and other media.</p>

						<p>Sonic is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies. Throughout the course of the video games, Sonic most commonly has to race through levels, collect power up rings and survive against a host of natural obstacles and minions to achieve his goal. While many individuals at Sega had a hand in Sonic's creation, programmer Yuji Naka and artist Naoto Ohshima are generally credited with the creation of the character.</p>

						<p>The first game was released to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in June 1991. Since then, Sonic has become one of the world's best-known video game characters, with his series selling more than 80 million copies.</p>

					<h3>Tails</h3>
						
						<p>Miles Prower, more commonly known by his nickname Tails, is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the title character's best friend and sidekick. Tails also appears in his own spin-off series as "Two Tails" in comic books, cartoons, as well as in an OVA.</p>

						<p>The name "Miles Prower" is a pun on "miles per hour", a reference to the famed speed of Sonic the Hedgehog. He is an eight-year-old fox with two tails, hence the nickname. A mechanical genius, he is able to use his two tails to propel himself like a helicopter. He debuted with the release of the 8-bit version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in October 1992. In the mid-1990s, he was featured as the main character in a number of spinoff games: Tails and the Music Maker for the Sega Pico, and Tails Adventure and Tails' Skypatrol for the Game Gear. According to an official poll from Sega, Tails is the third most popular character of the series.</p>

					<h3>Knuckles</h3>
						
						<p>Knuckles the Echidna is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. He is a red anthropomorphic echidna who is determined and serious but sometimes gullible. He can glide and climb up walls, and is a powerful fighter due to his spiked hands. He serves as the guardian of the Master Emerald, a huge gemstone that controls the series' integral Chaos Emeralds.</p>

						<p>Knuckles debuted in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in 1994 after Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. He first became playable in Sonic & Knuckles later that year; he learns of Eggman's trickery and teams up with Sonic during that game's events. Since then he has appeared in dozens of playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime.</p>

					<h3>Robotnik</h3>
						
						<p>Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. His original character designer was Naoto Ohshima, who created the character as part of many design choices for the company's new mascot. After the creation of Sonic the Hedgehog, Ohshima chose to use his previous egg-shaped character to create the antagonist of the 1991 video game, Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as making him become the archenemy of the series' eponymous main character.</p>

						<p>In main line of video games, Dr. Robotnik is a rotund mad scientist who plans to conquer the world in order to build his own Eggman Empire. While he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body, red-black-yellow clothing, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache. Robotnik possesses ability of creating machines and robots. Notably in early games, he has also served as a recurring boss, appearing in almost every level piloting one of his created vehicles.</p>

					<h3>Mecha Sonic</h3>
					
						<p>Mecha Sonic is an evil robotic version of Sonic created by Dr. Robotnik. He made his first appearance in Sonic & Knuckles where he challenges Sonic multiple times. After his defeat at the hands of Sonic, he challenges Knuckles and, upon defeat, flees to the Master Emerald, which he uses to achieve his own Super State. In this form, he is untouchable and does damage to whoever touches him. Knuckles is able to defeat him by striking when his power runs out and he is forced to go back to the Master Emerald for a short recharge. When Knuckles defeats the robot this time, he explodes, this time defeated for good. However, his destruction also takes the remains of the Sky Sanctuary with him. Knuckles barely escapes with Sonic's help, the latter piloting the Tornado.</p>
